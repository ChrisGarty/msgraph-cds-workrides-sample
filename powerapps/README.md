# Overview
In [PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/), you can manage organizational data by running an app that you created or that someone else, such as the HR manager in our scenario, created and shared with you. Apps run on mobile devices such as phones, or you can run them in a browser by opening Dynamics 365. You can create an infinite variety of apps â€“ all without learning a programming language such as C#.

PowerApps is used in this sample to facilitate expense reimbursement based on the data that is stored in a [Common Data Service](http://aka.ms/commondataservice) environment.

WorkRidesReimbursement.msapp

The PowerApps app can be opened saved into an environment using PowerApps Studio:
